# General
- There is no readme that explains what is going on, how to compile, what to expect. You should think as if someome with no knowledge is reading this repo and must understand how to compile and what to expect from each executable.
- `.vscode` and `__pycache__` folder should not be in the repo
- executables should not be in the repo
- `#include`s should not be relative and you should specify the location with the compile flag `-I`
- The iris dataset should be in a different folder
- Nice that there are unit tests and profiling tests
- Overall it is a nice work, with a lot of interesting implementations but the fact that it is not very well organized penalizes it a lot


# Code
## Major
- There are some of the "usual" erros: things passed by copy instead of reference and some const missing from arguments and methods
